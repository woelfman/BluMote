Installation Instructions for Android Software Development
==========================================================

Preferred development environment is Eclipse and the Google ADT. 

Follow the installation guide here:
	http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html
	
It is highly recommended that development be performed on an actual 
device due to the inability for the emulator to simulate bluetooth.
	
Once all the software is setup and the source code has been been cloned 
then the following process will setup the project:
- Create a new project
- Select 'create project from existing source'. Next.
- Navigate to the 'src' directory which contains source code and
manifest file. Next.
- Select build target, 2.3.3 or above is recommended. Next.
- Minimum SDK = 5 or higher
- Finish

If all goes well the project should be created and the source should
be compile with no errors.
